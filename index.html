    <h1>Privacy Policy for StackAttack</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>King Lizard Studios ("we", "our", or "us") built StackAttack as a free, ad-supported game. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>StackAttack does not directly collect, store, or transmit any personal information. The game stores your high score locally on your device using standard device storage (PlayerPrefs). This data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>

    <h3>Google AdMob</h3>
    <p>We use Google AdMob to display banner advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>General location data</li>
        <li>App usage data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">how Google uses data from partner apps</a>.</p>

    <h3>Google Play In-App Purchases</h3>
    <p>The app offers an optional in-app purchase to remove ads. Purchases are processed by Google Play. We do not collect or store any payment information. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h3>Unity Analytics</h3>
    <p>The app is built with the Unity game engine, which may collect basic analytics data such as device type, operating system version, and app usage statistics. See <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy">Unity's Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>StackAttack offers a one-time purchase to remove advertisements. This is a non-consumable purchase processed through the Google Play Store. We do not have access to your payment information.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>StackAttack is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The ads shown may be subject to Google's ad policies for general audiences.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or retain any personal data. Game data (high scores, purchase status) is stored locally on your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
